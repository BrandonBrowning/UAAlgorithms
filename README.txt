Anything related to only the algorithm should be under src/main in the appropriate folder.
Anything related to testing the algorithm should be under src/test in the corresponding folder.
If you add or move a directory be sure to update the build.xml in the root of the repository.
Anything relating to the algorithm should be compiled to target/classes in the corresponding folder (algorithm src, tests, etc...).
