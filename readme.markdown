# UA SIGCOMP Algorithms
---

### The Repository

This git repository will serve to store generic algorithms for programming problems and contests. Feel free to modify anything, as long as it is productive and purposeful, and help out when possible. 

Currently, we have several sections for different types of algorithms:

* Backtracking
* Branch & Bound
* Brute Force
* Combinations / Permutations
* Divide & Conquer
* Graph
* Greedy
* Recursive
	
### Readme / Documentation Formatting
Please use [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) for formatting any documentation for algorithms or any related projects. It's *cool* and __easy__ to use.

You can easily add code markup by surrounding code in tick marks (\`), such as, `int var = 0;`.

Or, you can just add your code on a new tab and type code freely.

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello, world!");
	}
